# Updating Raspberry Pi across major releases is problematic. Sometimes it
# works and sometimes it does not. The only reliable way to do this is to
# download the binary image of the new release and transfer the stuff we need
# from the old binary image to the new binary image. This script will read
# a previously saved backup and write it to the new image.
#
# Almost certainly should be run as root because of the ownership of the
# source and destination files.

# Invocation:
#  sudo restore4update <saved backup> <linux mounted image>
#
